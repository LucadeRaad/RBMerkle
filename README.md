# RBMerkle
Basic blockchain + fundamental of crytocurrency

Used the cryptolib library to create hashes of randomly generated text and numbers. Put them into a merkle tree (which is an example of blockchain) and also made it a red-black
tree for easier searching. The idea is that if the randomly generated text were valid cryptocurrency exchanges then this tree could authenticate that all inputs are valid.
